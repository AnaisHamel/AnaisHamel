## 🌟 Mind & Data Explorer 🧠📊

### 👩‍💻 About me  

Hello there! I'm Anaïs Hamel, PhD in Psychology and Neurosciences.  
My research explored the fascinating intersections of meditation, sleep, and memory in the aging process, combining neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and behavioral data to better understand the human mind.  

After completing my doctorate, I am now focusing on **data science** and its applications. I’m passionate about extracting insights from complex datasets, building models, and applying computational approaches to solve real-world problems.  

### 📊 Specialization
